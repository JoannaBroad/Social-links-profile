# Social links profile


## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting this repository.

This project serves as a hub for all my social networks, featuring buttons that direct you to each platform on a new page. Additionally, it provides a brief overview of who I am.

In the future, I might explore integrating something similar into my portfolio site, perhaps as a dynamic drop-down menu.

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to drop them on my Frontend Mentor page or email me at Joanna.broad93@gmail.com.

Thanks again for taking the time to explore this project.
